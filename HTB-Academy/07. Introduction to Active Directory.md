# Introduction to Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment.

## Active Directory Structure

Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.
At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:
![](https://i.imgur.com/yyEdTmw.png)

Here we could say that `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain and contains the subdomains (either child or tree root domains) `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` as well as the other objects that make up a domain such as users, groups, computers, and more as we will see in detail below. It is common to see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationships in organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. It is often quicker and easier to create a trust relationship with another domain/forest than recreate all new users in the current domain.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vcD7qJN.png)

The graphic below shows two forests, `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`. The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning that users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa. We can also see multiple child domains under each root domain. In this example, we can see that the root domain trusts each of the child domains, but the child domains in forest A do not necessarily have trusts established with the child domains in forest B. This means that a user that is part of `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local` domain by default even though a bidirectional trust exists between the top-level `inlanefreight.local` and `freightlogistics.local` domains. To allow direct communication from `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` and `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local`, another trust would need to be set up.

## Active Directory Terminology

#### Object
An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

#### Attributes
Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of [attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all) used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as `displayName` for `Full Name` and `given name` for `First Name`.

#### Schema
The Active Directory [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/schema) is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object. For example, users in AD belong to the class "user," and computer objects to "computer," and so on.

#### Domain
A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.

#### Forest
A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.

#### Tree
A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). Let's say we have two trees in an AD forest: `inlanefreight.local` and `ilfreight.local`. A child domain of the first would be `corp.inlanefreight.local` while a child domain of the second could be `corp.ilfreight.local`. All domains in a tree share a standard Global Catalog containing all information about objects that belong to the tree.

#### Container
Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

#### Leaf
Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.

#### Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A [GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid) is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute.

#### Security principals
[Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). In AD, security principles are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. We can also have local user accounts and security groups used to control access to resources on only that specific computer. These are not managed by AD but rather by the [Security Accounts Manager (SAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).

#### Security Identifier (SID)
A [security identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals), or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. Even if the security principle is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group. When a user logs in, the system creates an access token for them which contains the user's SID, the rights they have been granted, and the SIDs for any groups that the user is a member of. This token is used to check rights whenever the user performs an action on the computer.

#### Distinguished Name (DN)
A [Distinguished Name (DN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as `cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local`). In this example, the user `bjones` works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees. The Common Name (CN) `bjones` is just one way the user object could be searched for or accessed within the domain.

#### Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
A [Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/object-names-and-identities) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. In our example, `bjones` is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object `cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local` would be recognized as different from `cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7zoPHkS.png)

#### sAMAccountName
The [sAMAccountName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/naming-properties#samaccountname) is the user's logon name. Here it would just be `bjones`. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

#### userPrincipalName
The [userPrincipalName](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52250.active-directory-user-principal-name.aspx) attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of `bjones@inlanefreight.local`. This attribute is not mandatory.

#### FSMO Roles
Microsoft separated the various responsibilities that a DC (Domain Controller) can have into [Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/fsmo-roles) roles. These give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). There are five FSMO roles: `Schema Master` and `Domain Naming Master` (one of each per forest), `Relative ID (RID) Master` (one per domain), `Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator` (one per domain), and `Infrastructure Master` (one per domain). All five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain in a new AD forest. Each time a new domain is added to a forest, only the RID Master, PDC Emulator, and Infrastructure Master roles are assigned to the new domain. FSMO roles are typically set when domain controllers are created, but sysadmins can transfer these roles if needed.

#### Global Catalog
A [global catalog (GC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/global-catalog) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest. Standard domain controllers hold a complete replica of objects belonging to its domain but not those of different domains in the forest. The GC allows both users and applications to find information about any objects in ANY domain in the forest. GC is a feature that is enabled on a domain controller and performs the following functions:

- Authentication (provided authorization for all groups that a user account belongs to, which is included when an access token is generated)
- Object search (making the directory structure within a forest transparent, allowing a search to be carried out across all domains in a forest by providing just one attribute about an object.)

#### Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
A [Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/rodc-and-active-directory-schema) has a read-only Active Directory database. No AD account passwords are cached on an RODC (other than the RODC computer account & RODC KRBTGT passwords.) No changes are pushed out via an RODC's AD database, SYSVOL, or DNS. RODCs also include a read-only DNS server, allow for administrator role separation, reduce replication traffic in the environment, and prevent SYSVOL modifications from being replicated to other DCs.

#### Replication
[Replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/replication/active-directory-replication-concepts) happens in AD when AD objects are updated and transferred from one Domain Controller to another. Whenever a DC is added, connection objects are created to manage replication between them. These connections are made by the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) service, which is present on all DCs. Replication ensures that changes are synchronized with all other DCs in a forest, helping to create a backup in case one domain controller fails.

#### Service Principal Name (SPN)
A [Service Principal Name (SPN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names) uniquely identifies a service instance. They are used by Kerberos authentication to associate an instance of a service with a logon account, allowing a client application to request the service to authenticate an account without needing to know the account name.

#### Group Policy Object (GPO)
[Group Policy Objects (GPOs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) are virtual collections of policy settings. Each GPO has a unique GUID. A GPO can contain local file system settings or Active Directory settings. GPO settings can be applied to both user and computer objects. They can be applied to all users and computers within the domain or defined more granularly at the OU level.

#### Access Control List (ACL)
An [Access Control List (ACL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists) is the ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that apply to an object.

#### Access Control Entries (ACEs)
Each [Access Control Entry (ACE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-entries) in an ACL identifies a trustee (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists the access rights that are allowed, denied, or audited for the given trustee.

#### Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
DACLs define which security principles are granted or denied access to an object; it contains a list of ACEs. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object's DACL to determine whether or not to grant access. If an object does NOT have a DACL, then the system will grant full access to everyone, but if the DACL has no ACE entries, the system will deny all access attempts. ACEs in the DACL are checked in sequence until a match is found that allows the requested rights or until access is denied.

#### System Access Control Lists (SACL)
Allows for administrators to log access attempts that are made to secured objects. ACEs specify the types of access attempts that cause the system to generate a record in the security event log.

#### Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
An FQDN is the complete name for a specific computer or host. It is written with the hostname and domain name in the format [host name].[domain name].[tld]. This is used to specify an object's location in the tree hierarchy of DNS. The FQDN can be used to locate hosts in an Active Directory without knowing the IP address, much like when browsing to a website such as google.com instead of typing in the associated IP address. An example would be the host `DC01` in the domain `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. The FQDN here would be `DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`.

#### Tombstone
A [tombstone](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Tombstone) is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the `Tombstone Lifetime,` and the `isDeleted` attribute is set to `TRUE`. Once an object exceeds the `Tombstone Lifetime`, it will be entirely removed

#### AD Recycle Bin
his made it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller

#### SYSVOL
The [SYSVOL](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/8548.active-directory-sysvol-and-netlogon.aspx) folder, or share, stores copies of public files in the domain such as system policies, Group Policy settings, logon/logoff scripts, and often contains other types of scripts that are executed to perform various tasks in the AD environment. The contents of the SYSVOL folder are replicated to all DCs within the environment using File Replication Services (FRS).

#### AdminSDHolder
The [AdminSDHolder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) object is used to manage ACLs for members of built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It acts as a container that holds the Security Descriptor applied to members of protected groups. The SDProp (SD Propagator) process runs on a schedule on the PDC Emulator Domain Controller. When this process runs, it checks members of protected groups to ensure that the correct ACL is applied to them. It runs every hour by default. For example, suppose an attacker is able to create a malicious ACL entry to grant a user certain rights over a member of the Domain Admins group. In that case, unless they modify other settings in AD, these rights will be removed (and they will lose any persistence they were hoping to achieve) when the SDProp process runs on the set interval.

#### dsHeuristics
The [dsHeuristics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-dsheuristics) attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object used to define multiple forest-wide configuration settings. One of these settings is to exclude built-in groups from the [Protected Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-c--protected-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) list. Groups in this list are protected from modification via the `AdminSDHolder` object. If a group is excluded via the `dsHeuristics` attribute, then any changes that affect it will not be reverted when the SDProp process runs.

#### adminCount
The [adminCount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-admincount) attribute determines whether or not the SDProp process protects a user. If the value is set to `0` or not specified, the user is not protected. If the attribute value is set to `value`, the user is protected. Attackers will often look for accounts with the `adminCount` attribute set to `1` to target in an internal environment. These are often privileged accounts and may lead to further access or full domain compromise.

#### Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
ADUC is a GUI console commonly used for managing users, groups, computers, and contacts in AD. Changes made in ADUC can be done via PowerShell as well.

#### ADSI Edit
ADSI Edit is a GUI tool used to manage objects in AD. It provides access to far more than is available in ADUC and can be used to set or delete any attribute available on an object, add, remove, and move objects as well. It is a powerful tool that allows a user to access AD at a much deeper level. Great care should be taken when using this tool, as changes here could cause major problems in AD.

#### sIDHistory
[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-unsecure-sid-history-attribute) attribute holds any SIDs that an object was assigned previously. It is usually used in migrations so a user can maintain the same level of access when migrated from one domain to another. This attribute can potentially be abused if set insecurely, allowing an attacker to gain prior elevated access that an account had before a migration if SID Filtering (or removing SIDs from another domain from a user's access token that could be used for elevated access) is not enabled.

#### NTDS.DIT
The NTDS.DIT (New Technology Directory Services Directory Information Tree) file can be considered the heart of Active Directory. It is stored on a Domain Controller at `C:\Windows\NTDS\` and is a database that stores AD data such as information about user and group objects, group membership, and, most important to attackers and penetration testers, the password hashes for all users in the domain. Once full domain compromise is reached, an attacker can retrieve this file, extract the hashes, and either use them to perform a pass-the-hash attack or crack them offline using a tool such as Hashcat to access additional resources in the domain. If the setting [Store password with reversible encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/store-passwords-using-reversible-encryption) is enabled, then the NTDS.DIT will also store the cleartext passwords for all users created or who changed their password after this policy was set. While rare, some organizations may enable this setting if they use applications or protocols that need to use a user's existing password (and not Kerberos) for authentication.

#### MSBROWSE
MSBROWSE is a Microsoft networking protocol that was used in early versions of Windows-based local area networks (LANs) to provide browsing services. It was used to maintain a list of resources, such as shared printers and files, that were available on the network, and to allow users to easily browse and access these resources.
Today, MSBROWSE is largely obsolete and is no longer in widespread use. Modern Windows-based LANs use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for file and printer sharing, and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol for browsing services.

## Active Directory Objects

An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers.

![](https://i.imgur.com/roqX3rJ.png)

#### Users
These are the users within the organization's AD environment. Users are considered `leaf objects`, which means that they cannot contain any other objects within them. Another example of a leaf object is a mailbox in Microsoft Exchange. A user object is considered a security principal and has a security identifier (SID) and a global unique identifier (GUID). User objects have many possible [attributes](http://www.kouti.com/tables/userattributes.htm), such as their display name, last login time, date of last password change, email address, account description, manager, address, and more.

#### Contacts
A contact object is usually used to represent an external user and contains informational attributes such as first name, last name, email address, telephone number, etc. They are `leaf objects` and are NOT security principals (securable objects), so they don't have a SID, only a GUID. An example would be a contact card for a third-party vendor or a customer.

#### Printers
A printer object points to a printer accessible within the AD network. Like a contact, a printer is a `leaf object` and not a security principal, so it only has a GUID. Printers have attributes such as the printer's name, driver information, port number, etc.

#### Computers
A computer object is any computer joined to the AD network (workstation or server). Computers are `leaf objects` because they do not contain other objects. However, they are considered security principals and have a SID and a GUID. Like users, they are prime targets for attackers since full administrative access to a computer (as the all-powerful `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account) grants similar rights to a standard domain user and can be used to perform the majority of the enumeration tasks that a user account can (save for a few exceptions across domain trusts.)

#### Shared Folders
A shared folder object points to a shared folder on the specific computer where the folder resides. Shared folders can have stringent access control applied to them and can be either accessible to everyone (even those without a valid AD account), open to only authenticated users (which means anyone with even the lowest privileged user account OR a computer account (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) could access it), or be locked down to only allow certain users/groups access. Anyone not explicitly allowed access will be denied from listing or reading its contents. Shared folders are NOT security principals and only have a GUID.

#### Groups
A group is considered a `container object` because it can contain other objects, including users, computers, and even other groups. A group IS regarded as a security principal and has a SID and a GUID. In AD, groups are a way to manage user permissions and access to other securable objects (both users and computers). Let's say we want to give 20 help desk users access to the Remote Management Users group on a jump host. Instead of adding the users one by one, we could add the group, and the users would inherit the intended permissions via their membership in the group. In Active Directory, we commonly see what are called "[nested groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/nesting-a-group-in-another-group)" (a group added as a member of another group), which can lead to a user(s) obtaining unintended rights.

#### Organizational Units (OUs)
An organizational unit, or OU from here on out, is a container that systems administrators can use to store similar objects for ease of administration. OUs are often used for administrative delegation of tasks without granting a user account full administrative rights. For example, we may have a top-level OU called Employees and then child OUs under it for the various departments such as Marketing, HR, Finance, Help Desk, etc. If an account were given the right to reset passwords over the top-level OU, this user would have the right to reset passwords for all users in the company

#### Domain
A domain is the structure of an AD network. Domains contain objects such as users and computers, which are organized into container objects: groups and OUs. Every domain has its own separate database and sets of policies that can be applied to any and all objects within the domain. Some policies are set by default (and can be tweaked), such as the domain password policy. In contrast, others are created and applied based on the organization's need, such as blocking access to cmd.exe for all non-administrative users or mapping shared drives at log in.

#### Domain Controllers
Domain Controllers are essentially the brains of an AD network. They handle authentication requests, verify users on the network, and control who can access the various resources in the domain. All access requests are validated via the domain controller and privileged access requests are based on predetermined roles assigned to users. It also enforces security policies and stores information about every other object in the domain.

#### Sites
A site in AD is a set of computers across one or more subnets connected using high-speed links. They are used to make replication across domain controllers run efficiently.

#### Built-in
In AD, built-in is a container that holds [default groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups) in an AD domain. They are predefined when an AD domain is created.

#### Foreign Security Principals
A foreign security principal (FSP) is an object created in AD to represent a security principal that belongs to a trusted external forest. They are created when an object such as a user, group, or computer from an external (outside of the current) forest is added to a group in the current domain. They are created automatically after adding a security principal to a group. Every foreign security principal is a placeholder object that holds the SID of the foreign object (an object that belongs to another forest.) Windows uses this SID to resolve the object's name via the trust relationship. FSPs are created in a specific container named ForeignSecurityPrincipals with a distinguished name like `cn=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local`.


## Active Directory Functionality

There are five Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles. These roles can be defined as follows:

| **Roles**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Schema Master`            | This role manages the read/write copy of the AD schema, which defines all attributes that can apply to an object in AD.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Domain Naming Master`     | Manages domain names and ensures that two domains of the same name are not created in the same forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Relative ID (RID) Master` | The RID Master assigns blocks of RIDs to other DCs within the domain that can be used for new objects. The RID Master helps ensure that multiple objects are not assigned the same SID. Domain object SIDs are the domain SID combined with the RID number assigned to the object to make the unique SID.          |
| `PDC Emulator`             | The host with this role would be the authoritative DC in the domain and respond to authentication requests, password changes, and manage Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The PDC Emulator also maintains time within the domain.                                                                                      |
| `Infrastructure Master`    | This role translates GUIDs, SIDs, and DNs between domains. This role is used in organizations with multiple domains in a single forest. The Infrastructure Master helps them to communicate. If this role is not functioning properly, Access Control Lists (ACLs) will show SIDs instead of fully resolved names. |

### Trusts

A trust is used to establish `forest-forest` or `domain-domain` authentication, allowing users to access resources in (or administer) another domain outside of the domain their account resides in. A trust creates a link between the authentication systems of two domains.
There are several trust types.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6UXEQtM.png)


|**Trust Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Parent-child`|Domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain.|
|`Cross-link`|a trust between child domains to speed up authentication.|
|`External`|A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering.|
|`Tree-root`|a two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.|
|`Forest`|a transitive trust between two forest root domains.|

## Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC

While Windows operating systems use a variety of protocols to communicate, Active Directory specifically requires [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol), Microsoft's version of [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)), [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) for authentication and communication, and [MSRPC](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/MSRPC) which is the Microsoft implementation of [Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), an interprocess communication technique used for client-server model-based applications.

### Kerberos

Kerberos has been the default authentication protocol for domain accounts since Windows 2000. Kerberos is an open standard and allows for interoperability with other systems using the same standard. When a user logs into their PC, Kerberos is used to authenticate them via mutual authentication, or both the user and the server verify their identity. Kerberos is a stateless authentication protocol based on tickets instead of transmitting user passwords over the network. The Kerberos protocol uses port 88 (both TCP and UDP)

#### Kerberos Authentication Process
||
|---|
|1. The user logs on, and their password is converted to an NTLM hash, which is used to encrypt the TGT ticket. This decouples the user's credentials from requests to resources.|
|2. The KDC service on the DC checks the authentication service request (AS-REQ), verifies the user information, and creates a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which is delivered to the user.|
|3. The user presents the TGT to the DC, requesting a Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for a specific service. This is the TGS-REQ. If the TGT is successfully validated, its data is copied to create a TGS ticket.|
|4. The TGS is encrypted with the NTLM password hash of the service or computer account in whose context the service instance is running and is delivered to the user in the TGS_REP.|
|5. The user presents the TGS to the service, and if it is valid, the user is permitted to connect to the resource (AP_REQ).|

### DNS
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses DNS to allow clients (workstations, servers, and other systems that communicate with the domain) to locate Domain Controllers and for Domain Controllers that host the directory service to communicate amongst themselves. DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and is broadly used across internal networks and the internet. Private internal networks use Active Directory DNS namespaces to facilitate communications between servers, clients, and peers. AD maintains a database of services running on the network in the form of service records (SRV). These service records allow clients in an AD environment to locate services that they need, such as a file server, printer, or Domain Controller.

![](https://i.imgur.com/eHcVQVu.png)

#### Forward DNS Lookup
We can perform a `nslookup` for the domain name and retrieve all Domain Controllers' IP addresses in a domain.
```c
PS C:\htb> nslookup INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

#### Reverse DNS Lookup
If we would like to obtain the DNS name of a single host using the IP address, we can do this as follows:
```c
PS C:\htb> nslookup 172.16.6.5

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

#### Finding IP Address of a Host
If we would like to find the IP address of a single host, we can do this in reverse. We can do this with or without specifying the FQDN.
```c
PS C:\htb> nslookup ACADEMY-EA-DC01

Server:   172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

### LDAP
Active Directory supports [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) for directory lookups. LDAP is an open-source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication against various directory services (such as AD). The latest LDAP specification is [Version 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511), published as RFC 4511. A firm understanding of how LDAP works in an AD environment is crucial for attackers and defenders. LDAP uses port 389, and LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) communicates over port 636.

AD stores user account information and security information such as passwords and facilitates sharing this information with other devices on the network. LDAP is the language that applications use to communicate with other servers that provide directory services. In other words, LDAP is how systems in the network environment can "speak" to AD.

An LDAP session begins by first connecting to an LDAP server, also known as a Directory System Agent. The Domain Controller in AD actively listens for LDAP requests, such as security authentication requests.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uywrbos.png)

#### AD LDAP Authentication

LDAP is set up to authenticate credentials against AD using a "BIND" operation to set the authentication state for an LDAP session. There are two types of LDAP authentication.

1. `Simple Authentication`: This includes anonymous authentication, unauthenticated authentication, and username/password authentication. Simple authentication means that a `username` and `password` create a BIND request to authenticate to the LDAP server.
    
2. `SASL Authentication`: [The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) framework uses other authentication services, such as Kerberos, to bind to the LDAP server and then uses this authentication service (Kerberos in this example) to authenticate to LDAP. The LDAP server uses the LDAP protocol to send an LDAP message to the authorization service, which initiates a series of challenge/response messages resulting in either successful or unsuccessful authentication. SASL can provide additional security due to the separation of authentication methods from application protocols.

### MSRPC
MSRPC is Microsoft's implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC), an interprocess communication technique used for client-server model-based applications. Windows systems use MSRPC to access systems in Active Directory using four key RPC interfaces.

|Interface Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`lsarpc`|A set of RPC calls to the [Local Security Authority (LSA)](https://networkencyclopedia.com/local-security-authority-lsa/) system which manages the local security policy on a computer, controls the audit policy, and provides interactive authentication services. LSARPC is used to perform management on domain security policies.|
|`netlogon`|Netlogon is a Windows process used to authenticate users and other services in the domain environment. It is a service that continuously runs in the background.|
|`samr`|Remote SAM (samr) provides management functionality for the domain account database, storing information about users and groups. IT administrators use the protocol to manage users, groups, and computers by enabling admins to create, read, update, and delete information about security principles. Attackers (and pentesters) can use the samr protocol to perform reconnaissance about the internal domain using tools such as [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/) to visually map out the AD network and create "attack paths" to illustrate visually how administrative access or full domain compromise could be achieved. Organizations can [protect](https://stealthbits.com/blog/making-internal-reconnaissance-harder-using-netcease-and-samri1o/) against this type of reconnaissance by changing a Windows registry key to only allow administrators to perform remote SAM queries since, by default, all authenticated domain users can make these queries to gather a considerable amount of information about the AD domain.|
|`drsuapi`|drsuapi is the Microsoft API that implements the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol which is used to perform replication-related tasks across Domain Controllers in a multi-DC environment. Attackers can utilize drsuapi to [create a copy of the Active Directory domain database](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003/) (NTDS.dit) file to retrieve password hashes for all accounts in the domain, which can then be used to perform Pass-the-Hash attacks to access more systems or cracked offline using a tool such as Hashcat to obtain the cleartext password to log in to systems using remote management protocols such as Remote Desktop (RDP) and WinRM.|

## NTLM Authentication

#### Hash Protocol Comparison

| **Hash/Protocol** | **Cryptographic technique**                          | **Mutual Authentication** | **Message Type**                | **Trusted Third Party**                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `NTLM`            | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | Random number                   | Domain Controller                               |
| `NTLMv1`          | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | MD4 hash, random number         | Domain Controller                               |
| `NTLMv2`          | Symmetric key cryptography                           | No                        | MD4 hash, random number         | Domain Controller                               |
| `Kerberos`        | Symmetric key cryptography & asymmetric cryptography | Yes                       | Encrypted ticket using DES, MD5 | Domain Controller/Key Distribution Center (KDC) |

### LM
`LAN Manager` (LM or LANMAN) hashes are the oldest password storage mechanism used by the Windows operating system. Passwords using LM are limited to a maximum of `14` characters. Passwords are not case sensitive and are converted to uppercase before generating the hashed value, limiting the keyspace to a total of 69 characters making it relatively easy to crack these hashes using a tool such as Hashcat.

### NTHash (NTLM)
`NT LAN Manager` (NTLM) hashes are used on modern Windows systems. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol and uses three messages to authenticate: a client first sends a `NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE` to the server, whose response is a `CHALLENGE_MESSAGE` to verify the client's identity. Lastly, the client responds with an `AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE`. These hashes are stored locally in the SAM database or the NTDS.DIT database file on a Domain Controller. The protocol has two hashed password values to choose from to perform authentication: the LM hash (as discussed above) and the NT hash, which is the MD4 hash of the little-endian UTF-16 value of the password. The algorithm can be visualized as: `MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/axAEoJ0.png)

GPU attacks have shown that the entire NTLM 8 character keyspace can be brute-forced in under `3 hours`. Longer NTLM hashes can be more challenging to crack depending on the password chosen, and even long passwords (15+ characters) can be cracked using an offline dictionary attack combined with rules. NTLM is also vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.

An NT hash takes the form of `b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b`, which is the second half of the full NTLM hash. An NTLM hash looks like this:
```c
Rachel:500:aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2:::
```
- `Rachel` is the username
- `500` is the Relative Identifier (RID). 500 is the known RID for the `administrator` account
- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe` is the LM hash and, if LM hashes are disabled on the system, can not be used for anything
- `e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2` is the NT hash. This hash can either be cracked offline to reveal the cleartext value (depending on the length/strength of the password) or used for a pass-the-hash attack.

- Below is an example of a successful pass-the-hash attack using the [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tool:
```c
r3so1v3@htb[/htb]$ crackmapexec smb 10.129.41.19 -u rachel -H e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2

SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\rachel:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2 (Pwn3d!)
```

### NTLMv1 (Net-NTLMv1)
The NTLM protocol performs a challenge/response between a server and client using the NT hash. NTLMv1 uses both the NT and the LM hash, which can make it easier to "crack" offline after capturing a hash using a tool such as [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) or via an [NTLM relay attack](https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/practical-guide-to-ntlm-relaying-in-2017-aka-getting-a-foothold-in-under-5-minutes.html)

#### V1 Challenge & Response Algorithm
```c
C = 8-byte server challenge, random
K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0
response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C)
```

#### Example of full NTLMv1 hash
```c
u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c
```

### NTLMv2 (Net-NTLMv2)
The NTLMv2 protocol was first introduced in Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and was created as a stronger alternative to NTLMv1. It has been the default in Windows since Server 2000. It is hardened against certain spoofing attacks that NTLMv1 is susceptible to. NTLMv2 sends two responses to the 8-byte challenge received by the server. These responses contain a 16-byte HMAC-MD5 hash of the challenge, a randomly generated challenge from the client, and an HMAC-MD5 hash of the user's credentials. A second response is sent, using a variable-length client challenge including the current time, an 8-byte random value, and the domain name. The algorithm is as follows:

#### V2 Challenge & Response Algorithm
```c
SC = 8-byte server challenge, random
CC = 8-byte client challenge, random
CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name)
v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name)
LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC)
NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*)
response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC*
```

#### NTLMv2 Hash Example
```c
admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030
```

### Domain Cached Credentials (MSCache2)
In an AD environment, the authentication methods mentioned in this section and the previous require the host we are trying to access to communicate with the "brains" of the network, the Domain Controller. Microsoft developed the [MS Cache v1 and v2](https://webstersprodigy.net/2014/02/03/mscash-hash-primer-for-pentesters/) algorithm (also known as `Domain Cached Credentials` (DCC) to solve the potential issue of a domain-joined host being unable to communicate with a domain controller (i.e., due to a network outage or other technical issue) and, hence, NTLM/Kerberos authentication not working to access the host in question. Hosts save the last `ten` hashes for any domain users that successfully log into the machine in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Cache` registry key. These hashes cannot be used in pass-the-hash attacks. Furthermore, the hash is very slow to crack with a tool such as Hashcat, even when using an extremely powerful GPU cracking rig, so attempts to crack these hashes typically need to be extremely targeted or rely on a very weak password in use


## User and Machine Accounts

User accounts are created on both local systems (not joined to AD) and in Active Directory to give a person or a program (such as a system service) the ability to log on to a computer and access resources based on their rights. When a user logs in, the system verifies their password and creates an access token. This token describes the security content of a process or thread and includes the user's security identity and group membership. Whenever a user interacts with a process, this token is presented. User accounts are used to allow employees/contractors to log in to a computer and access resources, to run programs or services under a specific security context (i.e., running as a highly privileged user instead of a network service account), and to manage access to objects and their properties such as network file shares, files, applications, etc. Users can be assigned to groups that can contain one or more members. These groups can also be used to control access to resources.

### Local Accounts
Local accounts are stored locally on a particular server or workstation. These accounts can be assigned rights on that host either individually or via group membership. Any rights assigned can only be granted to that specific host and will not work across the domain. Local user accounts are considered security principals but can only manage access to and secure resources on a standalone host. There are several default local user accounts that are created on a Windows system:

- `Administrator`: this account has the SID `S-1-5-domain-500` and is the first account created with a new Windows installation. It has full control over almost every resource on the system. It cannot be deleted or locked, but it can be disabled or renamed. Windows 10 and Server 2016 hosts disable the built-in administrator account by default and create another local account in the local administrator's group during setup.
    
- `Guest`: this account is disabled by default. The purpose of this account is to allow users without an account on the computer to log in temporarily with limited access rights. By default, it has a blank password and is generally recommended to be left disabled because of the security risk of allowing anonymous access to a host.
    
- `SYSTEM`: The SYSTEM (or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) account on a Windows host is the default account installed and used by the operating system to perform many of its internal functions. Unlike the Root account on Linux, `SYSTEM` is a service account and does not run entirely in the same context as a regular user. Many of the processes and services running on a host are run under the SYSTEM context. One thing to note with this account is that a profile for it does not exist, but it will have permissions over almost everything on the host. It does not appear in User Manager and cannot be added to any groups. A `SYSTEM` account is the highest permission level one can achieve on a Windows host and, by default, is granted Full Control permissions to all files on a Windows system.
    
- `Network Service`: This is a predefined local account used by the Service Control Manager (SCM) for running Windows services. When a service runs in the context of this particular account, it will present credentials to remote services.
    
- `Local Service`: This is another predefined local account used by the Service Control Manager (SCM) for running Windows services. It is configured with minimal privileges on the computer and presents anonymous credentials to the network.

### Domain Users
Domain users differ from local users in that they are granted rights from the domain to access resources such as file servers, printers, intranet hosts, and other objects based on the permissions granted to their user account or the group that account is a member of. Domain user accounts can log in to any host in the domain, unlike local users. One account to keep in mind is the `KRBTGT` account, however. This is a type of local account built into the AD infrastructure. This account acts as a service account for the Key Distribution service providing authentication and access for domain resources. This account is a common target of many attackers since gaining control or access will enable an attacker to have unconstrained access to the domain.

### User Naming Attributes
Security in Active Directory can be improved using a set of user naming attributes to help identify user objects like logon name or ID. The following are a few important Naming Attributes in AD:

|||
|---|---|
|`UserPrincipalName` (UPN)|This is the primary logon name for the user. By convention, the UPN uses the email address of the user.|
|`ObjectGUID`|This is a unique identifier of the user. In AD, the ObjectGUID attribute name never changes and remains unique even if the user is removed.|
|`SAMAccountName`|This is a logon name that supports the previous version of Windows clients and servers.|
|`objectSID`|The user's Security Identifier (SID). This attribute identifies a user and its group memberships during security interactions with the server.|
|`sIDHistory`|This contains previous SIDs for the user object if moved from another domain and is typically seen in migration scenarios from domain to domain. After a migration occurs, the last SID will be added to the `sIDHistory` property, and the new SID will become its `objectSID`.|

### Common User Attributes
```c
PS C:\htb Get-ADUser -Identity htb-student

DistinguishedName : CN=htb student,CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
Enabled           : True
GivenName         : htb
Name              : htb student
ObjectClass       : user
ObjectGUID        : aa799587-c641-4c23-a2f7-75850b4dd7e3
SamAccountName    : htb-student
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111
Surname           : student
UserPrincipalName : htb-student@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```


## Active Directory Groups

They can place similar users together and mass assign rights and access. Groups are another key target for attackers and penetration testers, as the rights that they confer on their members may not be readily apparent but may grant excessive (and even unintended) privileges that can be abused if not set up correctly.

#### OUs vs Groups - difference
OUs are useful for grouping users, groups, and computers to ease management and deploying Group Policy settings to specific objects in the domain. Groups are primarily used to assign permissions to access resources. OUs can also be used to delegate administrative tasks to a user, such as resetting passwords or unlocking user accounts without giving them additional admin rights that they may inherit through group membership.

### Types of Groups
Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: `type` and `scope`. The `group type` defines the group's purpose, while the `group scope` shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. When creating a new group, we must select a group type. There are two main types: `security` and `distribution` groups.

The `Security groups` type is primarily for ease of assigning permissions and rights to a collection of users instead of one at a time. They simplify management and reduce overhead when assigning permissions and rights for a given resource. All users added to a security group will inherit any permissions assigned to the group, making it easier to move users in and out of groups while leaving the group's permissions unchanged.

The `Distribution groups` type is used by email applications such as Microsoft Exchange to distribute messages to group members. They function much like mailing lists and allow for auto-adding emails in the "To" field when creating an email in Microsoft Outlook. This type of group cannot be used to assign permissions to resources in a domain environment.

## Group Scopes

There are three different `group scopes` that can be assigned when creating a new group.

1. Domain Local Group
2. Global Group
3. Universal Group

#### Domain Local Group
Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local groups cannot be used in other domains but `CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains. Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.

#### Global Group
Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. A global group can only contain accounts from the domain where it was created. Global groups can be added to both other global groups and local groups.

#### Universal Group
The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`. They are available to all domains within an organization and can contain users from any domain. Unlike domain local and global groups, universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC), and adding or removing objects from a universal group triggers forest-wide replication.

### AD Group Scope Examples
```c
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup  -Filter * |select samaccountname,groupscope

samaccountname                           groupscope

Domain Guests                                Global

<SNIP>
```

### Group scopes can be changed, but there are a few caveats:

- A Global Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if it is NOT part of another Global Group.
    
- A Domain Local Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if the Domain Local Group does NOT contain any other Domain Local Groups as members.
    
- A Universal Group can be converted to a Domain Local Group without any restrictions.
    
- A Universal Group can only be converted to a Global Group if it does NOT contain any other Universal Groups as members.

## Important Group Attributes

Like users, groups have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm). Some of the most [important group attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/group-objects) include:

- `cn`: The `cn` or Common-Name is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services.
    
- `member`: Which user, group, and contact objects are members of the group.
    
- `groupType`: An integer that specifies the group type and scope.
    
- `memberOf`: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member (nested group membership).
    
- `objectSid`: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.


## Active Directory Rights and Privileges

`Rights` are typically assigned to users or groups and deal with permissions to `access` an object such as a file, while `privileges` grant a user permission to `perform an action` such as run a program, shut down a system, reset passwords, etc. Privileges can be assigned individually to users or conferred upon them via built-in or custom group membership. Windows computers have a concept called `User Rights Assignment`, which, while referred to as rights, are actually types of privileges granted to a user

## Built-in AD Groups

AD contains many [default or built-in security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups), some of which grant their members powerful rights and privileges which can be abused to escalate privileges within a domain and ultimately gain Domain Admin or SYSTEM privileges on a Domain Controller (DC). Membership in many of these groups should be tightly managed as excessive group membership/privileges is a common flaw in many AD networks that attackers look to abuse. Some of the most common built-in groups are listed below.

| Group Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Account Operators`                  | Members can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. They cannot manage the Administrator account, administrative user accounts, or members of the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups.            |
| `Administrators`                     | Members have full and unrestricted access to a computer or an entire domain if they are in this group on a Domain Controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Backup Operators`                   | Members can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions set on the files. Backup Operators can also log on to and shut down the computer. Members can log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, which, if taken, can be used to extract credentials and other juicy info. |
| `DnsAdmins`                          | Members have access to network DNS information. The group will only be created if the DNS server role is or was at one time installed on a domain controller in the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Domain Admins`                      | Members have full access to administer the domain and are members of the local administrator's group on all domain-joined machines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Domain Computers`                   | Any computers created in the domain (aside from domain controllers) are added to this group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Domain Controllers`                 | Contains all DCs within a domain. New DCs are added to this group automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Domain Guests`                      | This group includes the domain's built-in Guest account. Members of this group have a domain profile created when signing onto a domain-joined computer as a local guest.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Domain Users`                       | This group contains all user accounts in a domain. A new user account created in the domain is automatically added to this group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Enterprise Admins`                  | Membership in this group provides complete configuration access within the domain. The group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. Members in this group are granted the ability to make forest-wide changes such as adding a child domain or creating a trust. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.       |
| `Event Log Readers`                  | Members can read event logs on local computers. The group is only created when a host is promoted to a domain controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Group Policy Creator Owners`        | Members create, edit, or delete Group Policy Objects in the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Hyper-V Administrators`             | Members have complete and unrestricted access to all the features in Hyper-V. If there are virtual DCs in the domain, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `IIS_IUSRS`                          | This is a built-in group used by Internet Information Services (IIS), beginning with IIS 7.0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Pre–Windows 2000 Compatible Access` | This group exists for backward compatibility for computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Membership in this group is often a leftover legacy configuration. It can lead to flaws where anyone on the network can read information from AD without requiring a valid AD username and password.                                                                               |
| `Print Operators`                    | Members can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain along with any printer objects in AD. Members are allowed to log on to DCs locally and may be used to load a malicious printer driver and escalate privileges within the domain.                                                                                    |
| `Protected Users`                    | Members of this [group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#protected-users) are provided additional protections against credential theft and tactics such as Kerberos abuse.                                                                                                                   |
| `Read-only Domain Controllers`       | Contains all Read-only domain controllers in the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Remote Desktop Users`               | This group is used to grant users and groups permission to connect to a host via Remote Desktop (RDP). This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `Remote Management Users`            | This group can be used to grant users remote access to computers via [Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Schema Admins`                      | Members can modify the Active Directory schema, which is the way all objects with AD are defined. This group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.                                                                                                                    |
| `Server Operators`                   | This group only exists on domain controllers. Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files on domain controllers. By default, this group has no members.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Privilege**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight` | This privilege could give our target user the right to log onto a host via Remote Desktop (RDP), which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive data or escalate privileges.                                                                                                                 |
| `SeBackupPrivilege`             | This grants a user the ability to create system backups and could be used to obtain copies of sensitive system files that can be used to retrieve passwords such as the SAM and SYSTEM Registry hives and the NTDS.dit Active Directory database file.                                            |
| `SeDebugPrivilege`              | This allows a user to debug and adjust the memory of a process. With this privilege, attackers could utilize a tool such as [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz) to read the memory space of the Local System Authority (LSASS) process and obtain any credentials stored in memory. |
| `SeImpersonatePrivilege`        | This privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system.                                                        |
| `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`         | A user with this privilege can load and unload device drivers that could potentially be used to escalate privileges or compromise a system.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`      | This allows a process to take ownership of an object. At its most basic level, we could use this privilege to gain access to a file share or a file on a share that was otherwise not accessible to us.                                                                                           |

## Security in Active Directory

When we think about cybersecurity, one of the first things that come up is the balance between Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, also known as the [CIA Triad](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/education/what-is-the-cia-triad). Finding this balance is hard, and AD leans heavily toward `Availability` and `Confidentiality` at its core.

## General Active Directory Hardening Measures

The [Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.

#### LAPS
Accounts can be set up to have their password rotated on a fixed interval (i.e., 12 hours, 24 hours, etc.). This free tool can be beneficial in reducing the impact of an individual compromised host in an AD environment. Organizations should not rely on tools like this alone. Still, when combined with other hardening measures and security best practices, it can be a very effective tool for local administrator account password management.

#### Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)
Every organization needs to have logging and monitoring setup to detect and react to unexpected changes or activities that may indicate an attack. Effective logging and monitoring can be used to detect an attacker or unauthorized employee adding a user or computer, modifying an object in AD, changing an account password, accessing a system in an unauthorized or non-standard manner, performing an attack such as password spraying, or more advanced attacks such as modern Kerberos attacks.

#### Group Policy Security Settings
As mentioned earlier in the module, Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are virtual collections of policy settings that can be applied to specific users, groups, and computers at the OU level. These can be used to apply a wide variety of [security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-policy-settings) to help harden Active Directory. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the types of security policies that can be applied:

- [Account Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-policies) - Manage how user accounts interact with the domain. These include the password policy, account lockout policy, and Kerberos-related settings such as the lifetime of Kerberos tickets
    
- [Local Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/security-options) - These apply to a specific computer and include the security event audit policy, user rights assignments (user privileges on a host), and specific security settings such as the ability to install drivers, whether the administrator and guest accounts are enabled, renaming the guest and administrator accounts, preventing users from installing printers or using removable media, and a variety of network access and network security controls.
    
- [Software Restriction Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/software-restriction-policies/software-restriction-policies) - Settings to control what software can be run on a host.
    
- [Application Control Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control) - Settings to control which applications can be run by certain users/groups. This may include blocking certain users from running all executables, Windows Installer files, scripts, etc. Administrators use [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/applocker-overview) to restrict access to certain types of applications and files. It is not uncommon to see organizations block access to CMD and PowerShell (among other executables) for users that do not require them for their day-to-day job. These policies are imperfect and can often be bypassed but necessary for a defense-in-depth strategy.
    
- [Advanced Audit Policy Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/secpol-advanced-security-audit-policy-settings) - A variety of settings that can be adjusted to audit activities such as file access or modification, account logon/logoff, policy changes, privilege usage, and more.


## Examining Group Policy
### Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
A [Group Policy Object (GPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-objects) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to `user(s)` or `computer(s)`. GPOs include policies such as screen lock timeout, disabling USB ports, enforcing a custom domain password policy, installing software, managing applications, customizing remote access settings, and much more. Every GPO has a unique name and is assigned a unique identifier (a GUID).

### Example GPOs

- Establishing different password policies for service accounts, admin accounts, and standard user accounts using separate GPOs
- Preventing the use of removable media devices (such as USB devices)
- Enforcing a screensaver with a password
- Restricting access to applications that a standard user may not need, such as cmd.exe and PowerShell
- Enforcing audit and logging policies
- Blocking users from running certain types of programs and scripts
- Deploying software across a domain
- Blocking users from installing unapproved software
- Displaying a logon banner whenever a user logs into a system
- Disallowing LM hash usage in the domain
- Running scripts when computers start/shutdown or when a user logs in/out of their machine
