# Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

`Active Directory` (`AD`) is a directory service for Windows enterprise environments that was officially implemented in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000 and has been incrementally improved upon with the release of each subsequent server OS since. AD is based on the protocols x.500 and LDAP that came before it and still utilizes these protocols in some form today. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization’s resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides `authentication, accounting, and authorization` functions within a Windows enterprise environment.


**Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin**

During this engagement, I compromised a single host and gained `SYSTEM` level access. Because this was a domain-joined host, I was able to use this access to enumerate the domain. I went through all of the standard enumeration, but did not find much. There were `Service Principal Names` (SPNs) present within the environment, and I was able to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS tickets for a few accounts. I attempted to crack these with Hashcat and some of my standard wordlists and rules, but was unsuccessful at first. I ended up leaving a cracking job running overnight with a very large wordlist combined with the [d3ad0ne](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/rules/d3ad0ne.rule) rule that ships with Hashcat. The next morning I had a hit on one ticket and retrieved the cleartext password for a user account. This account did not give me significant access, but it did give me write access on certain file shares. I used this access to drop SCF files around the shares and left Responder going. After a while, I got a single hit, the `NetNTLMv2 hash` of a user. I checked through the BloodHound output and noticed that this user was actually a domain admin! Easy day from here.

**Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away**

Password spraying can be an extremely effective way to gain a foothold in a domain, but we must exercise great care not to lock out user accounts in the process. On one engagement, I found an SMB NULL session using the [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) tool and retrieved both a listing of `all` users from the domain, and the domain `password policy`. Knowing the password policy was crucial because I could ensure that I was staying within the parameters to not lock out any accounts and also knew that the policy was a minimum eight-character password and password complexity was enforced (meaning that a user's password required 3/4 of special character, number, uppercase, or lower case number, i.e., Welcome1). I tried several common weak passwords such as Welcome1, `Password1`, Password123, `Spring2018`, etc. but did not get any hits. Finally, I made an attempt with `Spring@18` and got a hit! Using this account, I ran BloodHound and found several hosts where this user had local admin access. I noticed that a domain admin account had an active session on one of these hosts. I was able to use the Rubeus tool and extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for this domain user. From there, I was able to perform a `pass-the-ticket` attack and authenticate as this domain admin user. As a bonus, I was able to take over the trusting domain as well because the Domain Administrators group for the domain that I took over was a part of the Administrators group in the trusting domain via nested group membership, meaning I could use the same set of credentials to authenticate to the other domain with full administrative level access.

**Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark**

I had tried all of my standard ways to obtain a foothold on this third engagement, and nothing had worked. I decided that I would use the [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) tool to attempt to enumerate valid usernames and then, if I found any, attempt a targeted password spraying attack since I did not know the password policy and didn't want to lock any accounts out. I used the [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) tool to first mashup potential usernames from the company's LinkedIn page. I combined this list with several username lists from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and, after using the `userenum` feature of Kerbrute, ended up with **516** valid users. I knew I had to tread carefully with password spraying, so I tried with the password `Welcome2021` and got a single hit! Using this account, I ran the Python version of BloodHound from my attack host and found that all domain users had RDP access to a single box. I logged into this host and used the PowerShell tool [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) to spray again. I was more confident this time around because I could a) view the password policy and b) the DomainPasswordSpray tool will remove accounts close to lockout from the target list. Being that I was authenticated within the domain, I could now spray with all domain users, which gave me significantly more targets. I tried again with the common password Fall2021 and got several hits, all for users not in my initial wordlist. I checked the rights for each of these accounts and found that one was in the Help Desk group, which had [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) rights over the [Enterprise Key Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#enterprise-key-admins) group. The Enterprise Key Admins group had GenericAll privileges over a domain controller, so I added the account I controlled to this group, authenticated again, and inherited these privileges. Using these rights, I performed the [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) attack and retrieved the NT hash for the domain controller machine account. With this NT hash, I was then able to perform a DCSync attack and retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain because a domain controller can perform replication, which is required for DCSync.

## What Are We Looking For?
The table below highlights the "`What`" in what we would be searching for during this phase of our engagement.

| `Domain Information` | Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.)                                                                                                                        |
| `Schema Format`      | Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Data Disclosures`   | For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain `intranet` site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.) |
| `Breach Data`        | Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

- `Any phishing or social engineering attacks`
- `Any other IPS/domains/subdomains not explicitly mentioned`
- `Any types of attacks against the real-world inlanefreight.com website outside of passive enumeration shown in this module`

### Setup

- A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
- They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
- They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (`htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
- "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
- Non-evasive testing.

### Initial Enumeration of the Domain

2.  From your scans, what is the "commonName" of host 172.16.5.5 ?

 SSH to with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

For that we need to first ssh to the target and run nmap scan for local IP
```c
ssh htb-student@10.129.143.83
```

After that we can run nmap scan for the given internal IP
```c
sudo nmap 172.16.5.5 -A

```

As we can see from the scan the commonName is  ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL which is under the RDP port 3389

3.  What host is running "Microsoft SQL Server 2019 15.00.2000.00"? (IP address, not Resolved name)

Once we are logged in, we can run fping which validates which hosts are active in the `/23` network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list: `a` to show targets that are alive, `s` to print stats at the end of the scan, `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and `q` to not show per-target results.
```c
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```
